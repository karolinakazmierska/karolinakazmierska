### Hi! 👋

👩‍💻  I am a Frontend Developer with **5+ years** of commercial experience. 

🖥  I've got experience working with **React** and **Vue**, but also **jQuery**. I've worked with **CSS**, **SCSS** & **Bootstrap**. I've created and managed websites with **WordPress**. I had also been learning **React Native (expo)** and exploring mobile app development. I've worked with both **REST** and **GraphQL** APIs. 

🌎  I speak fluent 🇬🇧 English, 🇲🇽 Spanish and 🇵🇱 Polish, and I have lived & studied in Poland, France and Mexico. I also have gathered some business experience in the fields of Project Management, (Digital) Marketing and content creation.
